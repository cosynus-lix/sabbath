# Semi-algebraic ABstrAcTor for Hybrid systems (SABbATH)

SABBATH is a formal verification and synthesis tool for dynamical and hybrid systems jointly developed in the [Cosynus team](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/cosynus/) at [LIX](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr) (the Ecole Polytechnique's Computer Science Laboratory) and the [Embedded System Unit](https://es.fbk.eu) at Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK).

The tool implements the algorithms presented in:

SABBATH, provides the following functionalities:

- Verify invariant properties for polynomial dynamical systems (i.e., dynamical systems with a polynomial Ordinary Differential Equations): [verify.py](#invariant-verification-of-dynamical-systems)

The tool implements the algorithm of [1] (using verification modulo theory techniques as backend, i.e., ic3ia) and the algorithms (dwcl, reach) from:

- Check stabilty for 2-modes, switched affine linear systems: [stability_hs.py](#stability-verification-for-hybrid-systems)

## Installation

### Dependencies
- python3
- pysmt (https://github.com/pysmt/pysmt)
- z3 solver (https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3)
- ic3ia (https://es-static.fbk.eu/people/griggio/ic3ia/index.html)

To install the base dependencies on Ubuntu you can try the following commands:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install python python-pip
$ sudo apt install -y build-essential swig libgmp-dev cmake
$ pip install nose pysmt sympy ply six scipy
$ pysmt-install --confirm-agreement --z3 --bdd
```

#### Dependencies for invariant verification:

The tool uses different external backends depending on the verification algorithm.

To use the Verification Modulo Theories [VMT](https://es.fbk.eu/index.php/projects/verification-modulo-theories/) algorithm you need to install the `ic3ia` tool from the [ic3ia website](https://es-static.fbk.eu/people/griggio/ic3ia/index.html).

The tool can use Mathematica (instead of z3 as SMT solver) as a backend of the `dwcl` and `reach` algorithm. You can install the [Wolfram Engine](https://www.wolfram.com/engine/), which implements the Mathematica backend and at the moment is free for academic purposes, or directly  Mathematica, and then install the `wolframclient` python package:
```
pip install wolframclient
```

#### Dependencies for stability verification:

The synthesis package uses `picos` as interface to different SDP solvers and the `control` package:
```
pip install picos control
```



## Invariant verification of dynamical systems

The script *verify.py* runs the verification algorithms for polynomial dynamical systems.

Consider the dynamical system:
$$\dot{x} = -2 * y$$
$$\dot{y} = x^2$$

starting from the initial set:
$$x + 2 > 0 \land 0 <= x - y - \frac{1}{2}$$

and the safety set:
$$(x + 2)^2 + y^2 - 1 > 0$$

![Verification problem](./docs/motexample_problem.png)

SABBATH verify if the dynamical system is safe analyzing a semi-algebraic decomposition of the state space  (i.e., a discrete abstraction that partition). The decomposition uses the following polynomials:
$$x - y - \frac{1}{2}$$
$$x + y + \frac{1}{2}$$
$$x + 2$$
to create a discrete abstraction where each state assigns a different sign to each polynomial:

![Semi-algebraic decomposition](./docs/motexample_abstraction.png)

This system and the polynomials are written in the file [Liu_Zhan_Zhao_Emsoft11_Example_25_motivating.invar](barrier/test/invar_inputs/Liu_Zhan_Zhao_Emsoft11_Example_25_motivating.invar), which follows the [input format](docs/input_format.md).

You can verify the system using the `ic3ia` SMT-based algorithm:
```
python verify.py --task ic3ia ./barrier/test/invar_inputs/Liu_Zhan_Zhao_Emsoft11_Example_25_motivating.invar 
```

The tool outputs several statitics, and eventually the result:
```
Liu Zhan Zhao Emsoft11 Example 25 new example Result.SAFE
```

You can change the algorithm in the `task` parameter (using `dwcl` and `reach`). Look at the help `verify.py --h` to get a list of the available options.

## Stability Verification of Hybrid Systems

The tool can verify stability properties for a specific class of hybrid systems (a switched system with 2 modes with linear dynamic).
