## Installation

### Dependencies
- python3
- pysmt (https://github.com/pysmt/pysmt)
- z3 solver (https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3)
- ic3ia (https://es-static.fbk.eu/people/griggio/ic3ia/index.html)

To install the base dependencies on Ubuntu you can try the following commands:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install python python-pip
$ sudo apt install -y build-essential swig libgmp-dev cmake
$ pip install nose pysmt sympy ply six scipy numpy
$ pysmt-install --confirm-agreement --z3 --bdd
```

#### Dependencies for invariant verification:

The tool uses different external backends depending on the verification algorithm.

To use the Verification Modulo Theories [VMT](https://es.fbk.eu/index.php/projects/verification-modulo-theories/) algorithm you need to install the `ic3ia` tool from the [ic3ia website](https://es-static.fbk.eu/people/griggio/ic3ia/index.html).

The tool can use Mathematica (instead of z3 as SMT solver) as a backend of the `dwcl` and `reach` algorithm. You can install the [Wolfram Engine](https://www.wolfram.com/engine/), which implements the Mathematica backend and at the moment is free for academic purposes, or directly  Mathematica, and then install the `wolframclient` python package:
```
pip install wolframclient
```

#### Dependencies for stability verification:

The synthesis package uses `picos` as interface to different SDP solvers and the `control` package:
```
pip install picos control
```



## Invariant verification of dynamical systems

The script *verify.py* runs the verification algorithms for polynomial dynamical systems.

Consider the dynamical system:
$$\dot{x} = -2 * y$$
$$\dot{y} = x^2$$

starting from the initial set:
$$x + 2 > 0 \land 0 <= x - y - \frac{1}{2}$$

and the safety set:
$$(x + 2)^2 + y^2 - 1 > 0$$

![Verification problem](./docs/motexample_problem.png)

SABBATH verify if the dynamical system is safe analyzing a semi-algebraic decomposition of the state space  (i.e., a discrete abstraction that partition). The decomposition uses the following polynomials:
$$x - y - \frac{1}{2}$$
$$x + y + \frac{1}{2}$$
$$x + 2$$
to create a discrete abstraction where each state assigns a different sign to each polynomial:

![Semi-algebraic decomposition](./docs/motexample_abstraction.png)

This system and the polynomials are written in the file [Liu_Zhan_Zhao_Emsoft11_Example_25_motivating.invar](sabbath/test/invar_inputs/Liu_Zhan_Zhao_Emsoft11_Example_25_motivating.invar), which follows the [input format](docs/input_format.md).

You can verify the system using the `ic3ia` SMT-based algorithm:
```
python verify.py --task ic3ia ./sabbath/test/invar_inputs/Liu_Zhan_Zhao_Emsoft11_Example_25_motivating.invar 
```

The tool outputs several statitics, and eventually the result:
```
Liu Zhan Zhao Emsoft11 Example 25 new example Result.SAFE
```

You can change the algorithm in the `task` parameter (using `dwcl` and `reach`). Look at the help `verify.py --h` to get a list of the available options.

## Stability Verification of Hybrid Systems

The tool can verify if a specific class of hybrid systems (switched systems with 2 modes with linear dynamic) is stable with the scripty [stability_hs.py](stability_hs.py). 

We can verify that the hybrid system in `utils/reformulate_PI_controller/hybrid_reformulation/reformulation_size_5.hyb` is stable with the following command:
```
python3 stability_hs.py utils/reformulate_PI_controller/hybrid_reformulation/reformulation_size_5.hyb --use-transpose --validation-method sylvester --solver mathematica
```

The tool output should be smilar to the following (and execute in about 10 seconds):
```
Parsing problem...
CRITICAL:root:Synthesizing lyapunov with transpose
CRITICAL:root:Time for synthesizing lyapunov: 0.04
CRITICAL:root:Time for validating c1: 0.01
CRITICAL:root:Time for validating c2: 0.02
CRITICAL:root:Time for validating lyapunov: 0.04
CRITICAL:root:Synthesizing lyapunov with transpose
CRITICAL:root:Time for synthesizing lyapunov: 0.01
CRITICAL:root:Time for validating c1: 0.01
CRITICAL:root:Time for validating c2: 0.02
CRITICAL:root:Time for validating lyapunov: 0.04
CRITICAL:root:Time for computing level set 0: 5.2
CRITICAL:root:Time for computing level set 1: 2.48
CRITICAL:root:Level set of M0 intersects M1
CRITICAL:root:Level set of M1 DOES NOT intersect M1
```

The tool:

- synthesizes two Lyapunov functions (one per mode) that are then validated with symbolic methods (i.e., the Lyapunov functions are sound). The function certifies that each hybrid system mode is globally asymptotically stable, in isolation (note that the hybrid system could be still non stable due to the switching).

- computes the stability regions for each mode of the hybrid system. The analysis guarantees that the system is stable if the execution starts inside the synthesized regions.


The tool saves the regions in the `numeric_info.mat` file.



The arguments of the script are:

- the input hybrid system

The [hybrid_reformulation](utils/reformulate_PI_controller/hybrid_reformulation/reformulation_size_10.hyb) folder already contains several models describing a PI controller for dynamical systems (which have various dimensions, 3, 5, 10, 15, 18).

- the method to use to synthesize the Lyapunov functions for single modes, one option among:


```
--use-transpose, --use-exponential, --use-control, --use-simple, --use-linear
```


- the method to use to validate the soundness of the Lyapunov functions:

```
--validation-method ['smt', 'sympy', 'sylvester']
```

- the SMT solver used in the analysis:

```
--solver ["z3","mathsat","cvc5","mathematica"]
```


### Hybrid systems from PI controller
The synthesis input can be generated from the description of a PI controller and a plant provided as Matlab matrices.

The conveter is in the [utils/reformulate_PI_controller](utils/reformulate_PI_controller). To run the conversion:
```
cd utils/reformulate_PI_controller
python matlab_to_hybrid_as_json.py
```

This script will create the output file (as hybrid automata) in the directory 
```
utils/reformulate_PI_controller/hybrid_reformulation
```
for the reformulated systems of size 3, 5, 10, 15, 18.
