# Semi-algebraic ABstrAcTor for Hybrid systems (SABbATH)

SABBATH is a formal verification and synthesis tool for dynamical and hybrid systems jointly developed in the [Cosynus team](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/cosynus/) at [LIX](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr) (the Ecole Polytechnique's Computer Science Laboratory) and the [Embedded System Unit](https://es.fbk.eu) at Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK).

The tool implements the algorithms presented in:

SABBATH, provides the following functionalities:

- Verify invariant properties for polynomial dynamical systems (i.e., dynamical systems with a polynomial Ordinary Differential Equations): [verify.py](#invariant-verification-of-dynamical-systems)

The tool implements the algorithm of [1] (using verification modulo theory techniques as backend, i.e., ic3ia) and the algorithms (dwcl, reach) from:

## Installation

### Dependencies
- python3
- pysmt (https://github.com/pysmt/pysmt)
- z3 solver (https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3)
- ic3ia (https://es-static.fbk.eu/people/griggio/ic3ia/index.html)

To install the base dependencies on Ubuntu you can try the following commands:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install python python-pip
$ sudo apt install -y build-essential swig libgmp-dev cmake
$ pip install nose pysmt sympy ply six scipy
$ pysmt-install --confirm-agreement --z3 --bdd
```

#### Dependencies for invariant verification:

The tool uses different external backends depending on the verification algorithm.

To use the Verification Modulo Theories [VMT](https://es.fbk.eu/index.php/projects/verification-modulo-theories/) algorithm you need to install the `ic3ia` tool from the [ic3ia website](https://es-static.fbk.eu/people/griggio/ic3ia/index.html).

The tool can use Mathematica (instead of z3 as SMT solver) as a backend of the `dwcl` and `reach` algorithm. You can install the [Wolfram Engine](https://www.wolfram.com/engine/), which implements the Mathematica backend and at the moment is free for academic purposes, or directly  Mathematica, and then install the `wolframclient` python package:
```
pip install wolframclient
```

#### Dependencies for stability verification:

The synthesis package uses `picos` as interface to different SDP solvers and the `control` package:
```
pip install picos control
```



## Invariant verification of dynamical systems

The script *verify.py* runs the verification algorithms for polynomial dynamical systems.

Consider the dynamical system:
$$\dot{x} = -2 * y$$
$$\dot{y} = x^2$$

starting from the initial set:
$$x + 2 > 0 \land 0 <= x - y - \frac{1}{2}$$

and the safety set:
$$(x + 2)^2 + y^2 - 1 > 0$$

![Verification problem](./docs/motexample_problem.png)

SABBATH verify if the dynamical system is safe analyzing a semi-algebraic decomposition of the state space  (i.e., a discrete abstraction that partition). The decomposition uses the following polynomials:
$$x - y - \frac{1}{2}$$
$$x + y + \frac{1}{2}$$
$$x + 2$$
to create a discrete abstraction where each state assigns a different sign to each polynomial:

![Semi-algebraic decomposition](./docs/motexample_abstraction.png)

This system and the polynomials are written in the file [Liu_Zhan_Zhao_Emsoft11_Example_25_motivating.invar](barrier/test/invar_inputs/Liu_Zhan_Zhao_Emsoft11_Example_25_motivating.invar), which follows the [input format](docs/input_format.md).

You can verify the system using the `ic3ia` SMT-based algorithm:
```
python verify.py --task ic3ia ./barrier/test/invar_inputs/Liu_Zhan_Zhao_Emsoft11_Example_25_motivating.invar 
```

The tool outputs several statitics, and eventually the result:
```
Liu Zhan Zhao Emsoft11 Example 25 new example Result.SAFE
```

You can change the algorithm in the `task` parameter (using `dwcl` and `reach`). Look at the help `verify.py --h` to get a list of the available options.

## Stability Verification of Hybrid Systems

The tool can verify stability properties for a specific class of hybrid systems (switched systems with 2 modes with linear dynamic) with the scripty [stability_hs.py](stability_hs.py). 


### Run PI_controller_converter

To run the conversion, run
```
cd semialgebraic_invariants/utils/reformulate_PI_controller
python3 matlab_to_hybrid_as_json.py
```

This script will create the file in the directory 
```
semialgebraic_invariants/utils/reformulate_PI_controller/hybrid_reformulation 
```
that are the hybrid automata for the reformulated systems of size 3, 5, 10, 15, 18.

### Synthesize and validate piecewise Lyapunov functions

Go back to main directory
```
cd ../..
```
and run the main script
```
python3 stability_hs.py
```
with arguments
#### problem
Give to stability a problem. One can select the ones created by the reformulator writing utils/reformulate_PI_controller/hybrid_reformulation/reformulation_size_10.hyb (and substituting 10 with 3, 5, 10, 15, 18).

#### method: chooseonefrom[--use-stranspose, --use-exponential, --use-control, --use-simple, --use-linear]

Select which method to use to synthesize the Lyapunov functions for single modes.

#### --validation-method chooseonefrom['smt', 'sympy', 'sylvester']

Choose which type of validation to use.

#### --solver chooseonefrom["z3","mathsat","cvc5","mathematica"]

Choose the smt-solver to be used.

### Examples of usage

Run
```
python3 stability_hs.py utils/reformulate_PI_controller/hybrid_reformulation/reformulation_size_5.hyb --use-transpose --validation-method sylvester --solver mathematica
```

The output should be (in around 10 seconds)
```
Parsing problem...
CRITICAL:root:Synthesizing lyapunov with transpose
CRITICAL:root:Time for synthesizing lyapunov: 0.04
CRITICAL:root:Time for validating c1: 0.01

CRITICAL:root:Time for validating lyapunov: 0.04

CRITICAL:root:Time for computing level set 1: 2.48
CRITICAL:root:Level set of M0 intersects M1
CRITICAL:root:Level set of M1 DOES NOT intersect M1
```
The Lyapunov function is synthesized, then it is validated. After that, two regions of certified stability (one for each mode) are synthesized. The result is saved in numeric_info.mat.
